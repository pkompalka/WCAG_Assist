# WCAG_Assist
Verification how code editors inform about WCAG accessibility issues and proposed solution for issues check.

Developed benchmark web applications in three different technologies: React, Angular and Vue.js in two versions â€“ with implemented accessibility and without accessibility. This allowed to check how and to what extent different code editors inform about lack of accessibility. It also allowed to conduct a comparative analysis of the code with and without accessibility in order to create script, which serves as a static code analyzer. This script detects and signals the lack of accessibility in the prepared code (it detected more than 60 violations of WCAG criteria), thus providing a useful help for the programmer.
